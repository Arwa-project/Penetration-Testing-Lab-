# Penetration-Testing-Lab-

## Description

The Penetration Testing Lab project simulates various penetration testing scenarios using a controlled lab environment. The lab setup consists of three virtual machines—Kali Linux (attacker machine), Metasploitable3 (vulnerable target), and a Windows Domain Controller (DC1)—designed to provide a realistic environment for practicing information gathering, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation techniques.

The main focus of the lab is to demonstrate:

Information Gathering using Nmap to discover live hosts and perform OS fingerprinting.
Vulnerability Scanning to identify services and potential exploits using tools like Metasploit.
Exploitation of known vulnerabilities such as the MS17-010 (EternalBlue), which allows remote code execution on the target.
Database Enumeration through brute-forcing credentials to access MySQL databases and extract sensitive information.
Service Scanning and Exploitation using Nmap scripts to identify and exploit additional services.
The lab documents all the steps and commands used, making it an excellent resource for beginners looking to understand penetration testing workflows.
